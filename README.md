## Optional: Add Device Images (Only if you want to edit or see device images)

If you want to see special device pictures on the homepage or edit them:

1. Open the `Pallavi-s-Project` folder on your computer (you can search for it in File Explorer).
2. Open the `public` folder inside it.
3. Inside `public`, create a new folder called `devices` (right-click > New > Folder > name it `devices`).
4. Put any images you want inside the `devices` folder, and rename them to:
   - `iphone1.png`, `ipad2.png`, `android1.png`, `laptop1.png`, `iphone.png`, `Ipad.png`, `android.png`, `tablet.png`, `battery.png`, `brokenscreen.png`

If you skip this, the app will still work, but you won't see those device images.
